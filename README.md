# SAP Cloud SDK  Samples
## Description
This repository contains code samples showcasing the [SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript / TypeScript](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/overview).
We plan to increase the number of samples over time. 
The samples will serve different purposes:
- There will be simple "Hello World" applications. They will contain a complete project with all configurations needed to execute it.
- There will be code samples to be used in an existing project. These samples do not work on their own but illustrate how to use the SAP Cloud SDK.
- There will be solutions to tutorials or training courses. These applications have larger scopes and showcase the business value you can create using the SAP Cloud SDK. 

## Requirements
The minimal requirements are:
- A terminal to execute commands
- A recent version of node and npm installed e.g. node 14 and npm 6
- An IDE or a text editor of your choice

If you want to explore the possibilities beyond local tests you need:
- Access to a [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html) account
- Entitlement to use resources like service instance creation and application processing units
- Permission to deploy applications and create service instances
